UCF Coding Boot Camp - Week Five Homework Assignment (Basic - Timed Trivia)

## Overview
Create a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML.  The Trivia Game should have a form with multiple choice or true/false options.


## Instructions
The user will be provided a landing page on starting the Trivia Game.  Once the "start" button has been pressed, it will take them to the multiple choice golf themed questions.  The user will have 30 seconds to answer all questions.

The game currently does not count the number of correct or incorrect answers, as that is not functioning at this time.  However; once working the results page will show how many questions were answered correctly and provides an option to restart the game.
